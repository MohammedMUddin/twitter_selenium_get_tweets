Lots of talk about flu vs covid.

6+ months into the pandemic and the fatality rates have dropped like a rock! Treatments are going well! If we're gonna compare influenza w/vaccines + flu shots we should compare #COVID19 rates from July-Sep and not Feb-Mar.

Simpsons time!

I'm not much for ""the Simpsons predicted it"" 'cause after 600 episodes, we're bound to have gotten some things right

But here's an eerily prescient line that was cut from the table draft of ""Sideshow Bob Roberts""

(Plus eerily out-of-date St. Elmo's Fire joke which I still love)
